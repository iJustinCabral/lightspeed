This is a practice training ground repo. Software Engineer Mike Acton gave a great talk about game engines, and during it he mentioned that one of the best ways to practice coding, is not to actually build side projects and applications because that should be reserved for learning how to build useful things at scale. Instead, for coding practice, you set a time limit and every day try to set out to build something in that set time. Then each day throw away the previous days code and start over. With the goal of eventually being able to progress further and further as your mental understanding of the code your writing strengthens. It not only helps you develop a better understanding of the language you write in, but how to do things more efficient over time. 

Thats what this repo will be. I'll start with 30 minutes at first and eventually move to an hour. (still deciding what to start with as the initial build)
